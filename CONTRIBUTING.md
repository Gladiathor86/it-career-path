# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in this repository.

This project documents my personal learning path in Linux, DevOps, Cloud and DevSecOps, and it is mainly maintained by me. However, I still keep a simple contribution process to practice professional workflows.

3. Commit your changes with **clear commit messages**:
